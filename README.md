SlickOut
========

Code for the excellent tutorial on game dev using Slick2D (which uses LWJGL) done by Tiago “Spiegel” Costa. I've added more features and made some changes to the game and am putting it here so that anyone can download and have a ready eclipse project to use.


The full tutorial is available at:

To try this out, you need to have eclipse with a valid workspace. Do a git clone using 

git clone https://github.com/plastygrove/SlickOut.git

in your workspace. Then import it using File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace
